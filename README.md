## Overview
This project is a university assignment for the Deep and Reinforcement Learning course. It features a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to recognize handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Utilizes TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training.
- Implements a CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
- Includes visualization of model architecture with `visualkeras`.
- Provides performance evaluation with accuracy and loss metrics.
- Contains sample predictions with visual confirmation.

## Requirements
The `requirements.txt` file contains all Python dependencies required to run this project. You can install them using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To train the model and evaluate its performance, run the Jupyter notebook `Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb`.
